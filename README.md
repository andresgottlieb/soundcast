# Announcement

I'm no longer developing Soundcast. I strongly recommend a newly available commercial solution that works flawlessly and includes all of the features people were asking for Soundcast:
- Automatic synchronized playback using as many devices as you wish (Chromecast, Apple TV, Airport Express, Bluetooth, iOS, Linux, etc)
- Sends cover artwork for the currently playing song to the TV
- Allows to optionally stream only a specific app's audio (eg. Spotify, Apple Music), so system sounds won't interfere with music
- Allows changing the streaming volume (and even linking it to the system volume)
- Has an integrated equalizer

They offered a $3 discount for people coming from Soundcast, if you visit them through the following link:

## Uninstalling

To remove Soundcast from your system

- if you installed using `cask`, you can do `brew cask uninstall soundcast`.
